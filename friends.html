        <h4>Friends with "Benefits"</h4>
        <p>In the first few weeks of semester 3 we had to create groups and make our own media agency. This will be the Agency we apply with for projects. We had to create things like an agency name, logo, brand identity, etc. According to that we applied for a project along with a motivation letter and an introduction video.</p>

                    In the first few weeks of this semester we got the assignment to create our own agency with our group. We started with this project by coming up with a name for our brand. A bunch of us asked ChatGPT for name ideas. I remembered that in high school I had an assignment to create a logo for a hacker. For that assignment I made a logo with a detective holding a magnifying glass, which brought me to an idea. In Dutch that is called a ‘loep’, but for a moment I thought it was written as ‘loop’. When I suggested that name to the rest of my group they all liked it. When we looked into it, we quickly realized that it is not written as ‘loop’, but we stuck with it because it has more than that one meaning. When coding we use the ‘for loop’ action a lot, so that is why we thought it is fitting with our agency. When we decided on the name I wrote down the core values, mission and an origin story. Later in the week we adjusted and refined these to perfectly fit with our agency.

            <div class="vertical-title">Style Scape</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Within our group we all individually made stylescapes. I decided to use soft, calm but still playful colors. I used squiggles and shapes to make it even more playful. I looked up logo ideas and came across one logo that perfectly fits our core values, I recreated the logo using a different font so it with the style. Because of our name I made an animation with a loop. I did this in Adobe Animate. This was my first time using the program. To learn the basics, I watched one YouTube tutorial and quickly got the hang of it. My goal was to make the O’s move just like a slot machine. This would also help with the legibility. There is a small chance that people read it as LUUP instead of LOOP. But the animation helps with this small problem. I showed the logo to a few people and everyone saw LOOP immediately, so it wasn’t really a problem to start with. But our teacher Jan did say that the longer he looks at it, the more he starts to overthink it and sees other things. So the animation is really helpful. Because I did not know if we were going to use my logo, I didn’t spend so much on the details. Later on I will fix it so it is smoother.
                    We compared all stylescapes and wrote down the differences and similarities. according to that we made the style scape on the right. We used bright neon colors to show that we are a daring agency. We used the Future font because it looks bold and futuristic, which fits perfectly with the core values. Everyone used shapes in their individual stylescapes, so for the final one we did to. And we decided to use my logo because it fits perfectly with our style and it is not a simple infinity loop symbol.

          <div class="vertical-title">Poster</div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
                After that was done we wrote down all of the things that needed to be done and assigned a job for everyone. We use Trello to keep track of all the duties and deadlines. I chose to make the poster for our brand. At first I struggled to come up with a design because we do not have any products or anything to show on the poster. That is why I decided to showcase our brand identity on the poster along with a QR code to our website. I used a lot of shapes and illustrations in the neon  colors we chose. To make it more understandable what kind of company we are, I added a screenshot of code. I also added the meaning of our brand along with our slogan. I used a bunch of programs to create the poster. The big arch in the middle I made with Figma because of the radial gradient. I used Photoshop for the paint splatter. And Illustrator for all of the other shapes. Some of them I made in Indesign. I played a lot with the placement of everything. At first I made the big arch in purple, but then I got the feedback from my teammate to make it yellow because we use a lot of yellow in de website.
