        <h2 class="title">Loop - Media Agency</h2>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Name choice</h4>
            <p>I came up with the name Loop. In high school I had an assignment to create a logo for a hacker. Back then I made a logo with a magnifying glass, in dutch that is called a loep. But for a moment I thought it was written as loop so I suggested it. Loop also has the meaning of looping in code or a rope. We found it fitting and went for it. Afterwards I also wrote down some core values, our mission and origin story, which we refined further in the project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Style scapes</h4>
            <p>I made a style scape in Adobe Illustrator. For my style scape I used soft, but cheerful colors. I tried making it even more playful by adding shapes and squiggles. After finding inspiration for the logo, I kind of recreated it with a different font. I also made an animation with Adobe Animate. This was my first time using the program so I looked up some tutorials. This animation helps a lot with the readability. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Poster</h4>
            <p>To catch the attention of potential stakeholders I made an eye catching poster. For this I used multiple programs like InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop and Figma. I used a lot of different techniques which I learned along the way.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="divider2"></div>


        <h2 class="title">Friends with "Benefits"</h2>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Concept</h4>
            <p>For this project we changed our concept once completely. At first we had the idea to create an educational news game for younger teenagers. But our stake holder did not seem very enthusiastic about the whole concept. So I did more research on existing games and came up with a guessing game. My initial idea was having cards with 5 statements on it which one player has to rank and the other players have to guess that one players ranking. What started out as an innocent game ended up being a very spicy 18+ party game. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Techniques</h4>
            <p>At first we wanted to have 3 levels, casual, mild and spicy. For this I had created a pinwheel to help keep the game exiting. I did this by making a pie slice and duplicating and rotating this until I got a full circle. On the board itself I had also used the 3 colors corresponding to the 3 levels. This way there would be another way of playing the game. Whichever color you land on is the card you pick on the next round. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Box design</h4>
            <p>Packaging is an important factor, it’s the first thing anyone sees about a product. Another teammate had already made a styles so I went off of that. I started by doing research to existing games. I wrote out everything that has to be on the box. After making sketches I started designing on illustrator. You can read more about the iterative process in LO 3.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Prototypes</h4>
            <p>I had created the packaging on a box template so it would be easy to print and put together. This way I was also able to make simple mockups. I downloaded free mockups from the internet and added my own design to create a mockup. This helped us visualize the product. Another teammate also made a design after doing even more research. We printed both on a piece of paper and put the boxes together. This way we were able to do AB tests. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Website</h4>
            <p>We created a product website for marketing. I made the whole home page. Our final design has a racoon mascot. I suggesting giving the racoon a name, which ended up being Rick. This will help with our marketing. In the FAQ section I added a lot of jokes about Rick. I also had the idea to make merchandise. We created condoms, grinders and shot glasses with a picture of Rick on it. When we presented this to our teacher, we got a lot of laughs and good feedback.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Portfolio</h2>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Website</h4>
            <p>I decided to make my digital portfolio a website. This way it is easier to find everything, keep it updated and I will be able to prove all learning outcomes.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Inspiration</h4>
            <p>I did research on color combinations and existing portfolios and website layouts. After collecting all of that I made wireframes in Figma. I took inspiration from another Turkish woman’s portfolio website. On her product page she has pictures up top and then proceeds to explain about the project. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Prototype</h4>
            <p>I worked my wireframes out until I got an interactive prototype. My previous portfolio website was very simple and did not fit with my style. This time around I added more character with the colors and shapes. I wanted to explore more techniques so I tried things like moving stars and horizontal scrolls. In LO2 you can read more about this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
            <h4 class="sub-title">Internship</h4>
            <p>I also made another portfolio to send out for internships. I did this in Adobe InDesign. The portfolios for school have a lot of text in them which I think is unnecessary for internships. That is why I tried to keep it as simple as possible. I picked out my 5 best projects I did so far. I made a lot of professional looking mockups which I think ended up looking very good. I did this by downloading mockups and adding my own images and changing the background color so it fits with the project. I think this is way better than just adding a low quality photo taken on my phone.  </p>
